# Facebook+

Facebook+ is a Facebook-like desktop app that allows users to access and modify their Facebook information. The app utilizes the Facebook API to provide users with a seamless experience and incorporates advanced features such as multithreading and various design patterns to ensure optimal performance and scalability. For each design pattern I used, I created UML diagrams, including a class diagram and a sequence diagram, to ensure that the project was well-organized and designed. Facebook+ is built using C# and WinForms and was created as part of a design pattern course in the Academic College of Tel Aviv Yaffo.
